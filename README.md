testVideoPlayer
===============

This video player was developed a s a test.  But feel free to use it as as you like.  It was developed with no external libraries like OSMF, or even greensock, so it's pretty bare.  I would not recommend using this player as there are significant elements missing from it (ie: no fullscreen, minimal scrubbing features, works based on an xml rather that a supporting javascript library...)  VERY MINIMAL.
