testVideoPlayer
===============

This video player was developed to comply to a test.  But feel free to use it as as you like.  It was developed with no external libraries like OSMF, or even greensock, so it's pretty bare.  I would not recommend using this player as-is, due to the lack of features and certain base functionalities expected with current commercial players. There are significant elements missing from it (ie: no fullscreen, minimal scrubbing features, works based on an xml rather that a supporting javascript library...)  VERY MINIMAL.  This player does not work with pepper flash, so if you are using chrome, make sure to disable the pepperflash plugin, and use the adobe flashplaer npapi pluggin.

Having said all that, this player would be a good starting point for novice to intermediate video player developers.  Documentation has been provided via asdoc, however, there are very little, if any at all, developer comments in the code.
I feel most of it is self-explanatory, and I rather not extend further time into this little project, unless some-one requires it.  

I also have structured the methods and properties in the classes alphabetically, so it should be fairly simple to find a method/function that you may be looking for.

Kind Regards,
Mike
